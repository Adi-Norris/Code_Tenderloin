            Abstract:
        </h1>
        <p>This is a paper I wrote in 2020 about the hunting habits of lions 
        titled "Are Lions Stalking or Coursing Predators." Stalking predators
        generally hunt alone and employ stealth. Coursing predators hunt in groups 
        and wear down their prey. Most cats are obviously stalking predators,
        however lions live in groups called prides. The fact that lions'
        bodies are like those of other cats but they hunt in groups was intriguing,
        so I set out to determine whether they are stalking or coursing
        predators. After much in depth research, is that lions' hunting
        habits change depending on different circumstances. When one or more
        males hunt or when the prey is large, they use coursing strategies.
        For smaller prey or when there are no males, they use stalking 
        strategies.</p>
        <p>Please check out the sources page. In addition to my
            bibliography, there are videos that demonstrate my conclusion.
        Naturally, please look at the paper as well.</p>
