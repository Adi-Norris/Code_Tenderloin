            Are Lions Stalking or Coursing Predators? 
        </h1>
        <div class="box">
        <p>
            Among terrestrial predators, there are two common types of predation; stalking and coursing. Stalking predators “...hunt in heavier cover and have variable selection, often selecting prime-condition prey” (Murray 2002). They use stealth to approach prey, then quickly kill it. Stalking predators also typically hunt alone, but there can be exceptions to this. Tigers are stalking predators. Coursing predators “...chase prey over long distances in open habitat and have a relatively low success rate, selecting substandard prey” (Murray, 2002). They hunt in groups and have the stamina to chase prey for extended periods of time. Another identifying feature is that when attacking a group or herd, they target the weakest members. Wolves are a prime example of coursing predators.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is one other way that terrestrial predators hunt; ambush predation. Ambush predators camouflage themselves into their environment, then wait for unsuspecting prey to come near them. When that occurs, they attack the prey and bring it down. Alligators mainly use ambush tactics. However, ambush predation does not have a major place in this paper.
        </p>

            The question this paper intends to solve is whether lions are stalking or coursing predators. Every other cat species is unequivocally a stalking predator and there are no significant morphological differences in lions. Additionally, many contemporary peer-reviewed articles refer to lions as stalking predators (Hayward et. al, 2011). However, lions also happen to be the only cat species that hunts in groups. They hunt in open plains and their success rate is low. Therefore, more research is needed into how lions hunt before this question can be answered conclusively. This paper will explore further research into the subject to reach a conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to the website of Bali Safari Park, lions have two different methods of hunting. The first method described is very similar to stalking predation:
        </p>
        <p class="smaller">
            "This is the primary way that they hunt, which is to stay hidden for as long as possible while they approach their prey. This is another advantage that the Lioness has over the male, in that their bodies are slimmer, allowing them to stay hidden in the grass longer. Lionesses also work together when they hunt by surrounding their prey as they stay hidden. Eventually, though, the prey will notice or hear the approaching Lion, in which it will become a chase for them both. Once the Lion catches up to the prey, they use their powerful claws to maul at their prey and crush their necks, leaving them paralyzed to be taken back to the Lion’s home." 
        </p>
        <p>
            The second method is close to coursing predation:
        </p>
        <p class="smaller">
            "This is when the male Lion also joins the hunt together with the Lionesses. For the second method, there is no hiding or stalking involved, they go for the big prey and then corner it strategically. Once the prey is cornered, the Lion comes in face to face to fight with the animal. In this scenario, the weight, brute strength and bravery of the Lion is what will determine the outcome of the hunt."
        </p>
        <p>
            The website of Snow Africa Adventures, a safari guide for Tanzania Safari also lists two hunting methods of lions with videos from BBC Earth as examples. The first method is described as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="smaller">
            "The lion prides usually jump on the slow one, the strongest lion used to capture and the rest of them join afterward in the hunting session."
        </p>
        <p>
            The accompanying video shows lions surrounding a herd of buffalo and taking one down. The lions do not use stealth and there are several males present. The other method relies almost solely on stealth:
        </p>
        <p class="smaller">
            "They have intense stalking tricks as their skin color mixes with the savannah grasses it became easy for them to hide. Once the lion is sure it can catch the target it will jump off on its prey."
        </p>
        <p>
            The accompanying video shows a lion sneaking up on a warthog and drawing it towards another lion in hiding.
        </p>
        <p>
            The answer to this paper’s question is that lions use both stalking and coursing strategies depending on prey size and whether or not a male is a member of the hunting party. For larger prey (ex. buffalo) and/or when a male joins the hunt, they use coursing strategies. For smaller prey (ex. warthogs), they use group stalking strategies. However, they are not able to chase their prey over long distances as they have small hearts and lungs, so it is never 100% coursing predation. And although they have been recorded using ambush predation, this does not occur very often. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This solution leaves some things unanswered. Lions hunt both diurnally and nocturnally, and research suggests that the time of day does significantly impact hunting habits (Van Orsdol 1984). Additionally, the behaviours mentioned in the previous paragraph don’t perfectly fit the definitions of stalking and coursing. Nevertheless, I am confident that this paper sheds light onto the question of whether lions are stalking predators or coursing predators.
